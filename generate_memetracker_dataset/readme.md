Code for generating MemeTracker dataset<br>
original dataset can be available at http://memetracker.org.
****
**network**: code for generating real-world network from MemeTracker dataset: extract top media and blog sites w.r.t. number of documents,  
from which we create a network where there is an directed edge (vi,vj) if a post on a site vi linked to a post on a site vj.<br>
**hyperlink**: code for generating real-world diffusion results/cascades from MemeTracker dataset.
